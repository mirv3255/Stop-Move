_**Stop & Move Analysis**_

This project analyzes human movement patterns by detecting stop and move segments from trajectory data. The notebook processes GPS data to classify movement states, which can be useful for GIS research, human mobility studies, and urban planning.
This program identifies the stopping state of trajectory data based on spatial and semantic parameters.

**Features**

Reads trajectory data from CSV formats.

Identifies stop and move segments based on temporal and spatial thresholds.

Visualizes movement patterns with interactive plots.

Provides statistical summaries of movement behavior, such as stop durations and movement distances.

Exports processed data for further analysis.

**Requirements**

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas folium

**Usage**

Open the Jupyter Notebook (Stop_Move.ipynb).

Load your trajectory dataset (ensure it has timestamps, latitude, and longitude columns).

Adjust parameters for movement classification if necessary.

Run the cells to process the data and generate movement insights.

Explore visualizations and summary statistics.

Export results for further GIS-based analysis.

**Data**

This project requires trajectory and OSM datasets for analysis. Please download the two datasets from the links below and place them in your Kolb repository. The download links will be added here later.

**Example Output**

Summary statistics: Insights into movement behaviors such as average stop durations.
Exported datasets: CSV files containing classified movement states.

**Applications**

This analysis can be applied in various domains, including:
Urban mobility and transportation planning
Human behavior analysis
Environmental and ecological studies
Location-based services and geospatial analytics
